## Let's play with Container

### Docker Images
```bash
  docker image ls
```

To pull image Nginx
```bash
  docker image pull nginx
  docker image ls
```

To inspect container image, take note on
- repoTag
- Env (environment variables)
- Cmd (commands executed when containers started up)
```bash
  docker image inspect [imageid]
```

### Docker Container
Let's try to run busybox, which essentially will run "ls" command and then stop
```bash
  docker container run busybox
  docker container ls
  docker container ls -a
```

Let's try to run nginx in the background (-d), bind the port to any random available host port (-P)
```bash
  docker container run -P -d nginx
  docker container ps
```

Inspect the container, and observe the private IP assigned to it
```bash
  docker container inspect [containerid]
  curl http://[containerprivateip]
```
