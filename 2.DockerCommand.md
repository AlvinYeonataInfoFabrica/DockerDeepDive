## Let's play with Container

### Docker Images
```bash
  docker image ls
```

To pull image Nginx
```bash
  docker image pull nginx
  docker image ls
```

To inspect container image, take note on
- repoTag
- Env (environment variables)
- Cmd (commands executed when containers started up)
```bash
  docker image inspect [imageid]
```
