## Let's play with Container

### Docker Images
```bash
  docker image ls
```

To pull image Nginx
```bash
  docker image pull nginx
  docker image ls
```

To inspect container image, take note on
- repoTag
- Env (environment variables)
- Cmd (commands executed when containers started up)
```bash
  docker image inspect [imageid]
```

### Docker Container
Let's try to run busybox, which essentially will run "ls" command and then stop
```bash
  docker container run busybox
  docker container ls
  docker container ls -a
```

Let's try to run nginx in the background (-d), bind the port to any random available host port (-P)
```bash
  docker container run -P -d nginx
  docker container ps
```

Inspect the container, and observe the private IP assigned to it
```bash
  docker container inspect [containerid]
  curl http://[containerprivateip]
  #or
  curl localhost:[ContainerHostPort]
```

Now let's try docker container top, logs 
```bash
  docker container top [containerid]
  docker container logs [containerid]
  #if there is no logs, use 'curl localhost:[ContainerHostPort]' to generate some access logs 
```

Let's try attach / detach to access container stdout & stderr, start and stop container
```bash
  docker container attach [containerid]
  #press Ctrl+C to detach, once detached, the container will go to a stopped state
  docker container ls
  docker container ls -a
  docker container start [containerid]
  docker container ls
  docker container stop [containerid]
```

Let's get a live stream/real time resource usage of container using stats
```bash
  docker container stats [containerid]
```

Let's login to your container and execute command interactively (-i) in terminal (-t)
```bash
  docker container exec -it [containerid] /bin/bash
  ls
  # to prove we are inside nginx 
  ls /usr/share/nginx/html/
  exit 
  # alternative way
  docker container exec -it [containerid] ls /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

To pause / unpause all processes running in your container
```bash
  docker container pause [containerid]
  docker container ls # check for the (Paused) status
  docker container unpause [containerid]
```

Ok, finally lets clean up our container
```bash
  # -f to force stop and remove
  docker container rm -f [containerid]
  docker container ls -a
  # OR use prune to delete all STOPPED containers
  docker container prune 
  docker container ls -a
```
