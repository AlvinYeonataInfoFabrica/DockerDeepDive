## What is the Dockerfile?

Dockerfiles are instructions. They contains all of the commands used to build an image.
- Docker images consist of read-only layers.
- Each represents a Dockerfile instruction.
- Layers are stacked.
- Each layer is a result of the changes from the previous layer.
- Images are built using the docker image build command.

## Dockerfile Layers

Let's create our first Dockerfile together!
```bash
Dockerfile:  
FROM ubuntu:15.04  
COPY . /app  
RUN make /app  
CMD python /app/app.py
```
- FROM creates a layer from the ubuntu:15.04 Docker image.
- COPY adds files from your Docker client’s current directory.
- RUN builds your application with make.
- CMD specifies what command to run within the container.

## Best Practices

General guidelines:
- Keep containers as ephemeral as possible.
- Follow Principle 6 of the 12 Factor App.
- Avoid including unnecessary files.
- Use .dockerignore.
- Use multi-stage builds.
- Don’t install unnecessary packages.
- Decouple applications.
- Minimize the number of layers.
- Sort multi-line arguments.
- Leverage build cache.

## Working with Dockerfiles
```
FROM: Initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image
RUN: Will execute any commands in a new layer
CMD: Provides a default for an executing container. There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile
LABEL: Adds metadata to an image
EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime
ENV: Sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>
ADD: Copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>.
COPY: Copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.
ENTRYPOINT: Allows for configuring a container that will run as an executable
VOLUME: Creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers
USER: Sets the user name (or UID) and optionally the user group (or GID) to use when running the image and for any RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile
WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile
ARG: Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command, using the --build-arg <varname>=<value> flag
ONBUILD: Adds a trigger instruction to the image that will be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build
HEALTHCHECK: Tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working
SHELL: Allows the default shell used for the shell form of commands to be overridden
```

To setup environment:
```bash
sudo yum install git -y # only run this if you don't have git installed
mkdir docker_images
cd docker_images
mkdir weather-app
cd weather-app
git clone https://github.com/antoniuslee/content-weather-app.git src
```

Create Dockerfile. Build Image and Run Container
```bash
  vi Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile Contents:
```
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ./bin/www
```

Build the weather-app image:
```bash
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v1 .
```

List the images:
```bash
docker image ls
```
Create the weather-app container:
```bash
docker container run -d --name weather-app1 -p 8081:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app:v1
```

List all running containers:
```bash
docker container ls
```

Test your running container:
```bash
curl localhost:8081
```

## Working with Environment Variables
Setup your environment:
```bash
cd docker_images
mkdir env
cd env
```
Use the --env flag to pass an environment variable when building an image:
```bash
--env [KEY]=[VALUE]
```
Use the ENV instruction in the Dockerfile:
```bash
ENV [KEY]=[VALUE]  
ENV [KEY] [VALUE]
```
Clone the weather-app:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src
```
Create the Dockerfile
```bash
vi Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile contents:
```bash
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
ENV NODE_ENV="development"
ENV PORT 3000

RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
EXPOSE $PORT
CMD ./bin/www
```

Create the weather-app container:
```
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v2 .
```

Inspect the container to see the environment variables:
```
docker image inspect linuxacademy/weather-app:v2
```

Deploy the weather-dev application:
```
docker container run -d --name weather-dev -p 8082:3001 --env PORT=3001 linuxacademy/weather-app:v2
```

Inspect the development container to see the environment variables:
```
docker container inspect weather-dev
```

Deploy the weather-app to production:
```
docker container run -d --name weather-app2 -p 8083:3001 --env PORT=3001 --env NODE_ENV=production linuxacademy/weather-app:v2
```

Inspect the production container to see the environment variables:
```
docker container inspect weather-app2
```

Get the logs for weather-app2:
```
docker container logs weather-app2
docker container run -d --name weather-prod -p 8084:3001 --env NODE_ENV=production linuxacademy/weather-app:v2
```

## Build Arguments
Buid Arguments is used to parameterize an image build. It is only used during image build time.

Use the --build-arg flag when building an image:
```bash
--build-arg [NAME]=[VALUE]
```

Use the ARG instruction in the Dockerfile:
```bash
ARG [NAME]=[DEFAULT_VALUE]
```

Navigate to the args directory:
```bash
cd docker_images
mkdir args
cd args
```

Clone the weather-app:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src
```

Create the Dockerfile:
```bash
vi Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile:
```bash
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
ARG SRC_DIR=/var/node

RUN mkdir -p $SRC_DIR
ADD src/ $SRC_DIR
WORKDIR $SRC_DIR
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ./bin/www
```

Create the weather-app container:
```bash
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v3 --build-arg SRC_DIR=/var/code .
```

Inspect the image:
```bash
docker image inspect linuxacademy/weather-app:v3 | grep WorkingDir
```

Create the weather-app container:
```bash
docker container run -d --name weather-app3 -p 8085:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app:v3
```

Verify that the container is working by executing curl:
```bash
curl localhost:8085
```
