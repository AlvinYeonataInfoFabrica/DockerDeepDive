## What is the Dockerfile?

Dockerfiles are instructions. They contains all of the commands used to build an image.
- Docker images consist of read-only layers.
- Each represents a Dockerfile instruction.
- Layers are stacked.
- Each layer is a result of the changes from the previous layer.
- Images are built using the docker image build command.

## Dockerfile Layers

Let's create our first Dockerfile together!
```bash
Dockerfile:  
FROM ubuntu:15.04  
COPY . /app  
RUN make /app  
CMD python /app/app.py
```
- FROM creates a layer from the ubuntu:15.04 Docker image.
- COPY adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory.
- RUN builds your application with make.
- CMD specifies what command to run within the container.
